Machine Learning Projects - CodSoft Internship
          Welcome to my GitHub repository showcasing the projects I completed during my CodSoft internship. This repository includes three machine learning projects: Movie Genre Classification, Credit Card Fraud Detection, and SMS Spam Detection. Each project demonstrates different aspects of machine learning, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

Projects
1. Movie Genre Classification
This project involves building a model to predict the genre of a movie based on its title and description. By leveraging techniques such as Natural Language Processing (NLP) and various machine learning algorithms, the system can classify movies into genres like Action, Comedy, Drama, and more.

Technologies Used:
train_test_split
TfidfVectorizer
LogisticRegression
MultinomialNB

2. Credit Card Fraud Detection
This project focuses on identifying fraudulent credit card transactions. The goal is to build a model that can accurately distinguish between fraudulent and legitimate transactions by analyzing patterns in the data.

Technologies Used:
train_test_split
LogisticRegression
MultinomialNB

3. SMS Spam Detection
The aim of this project is to classify SMS messages as spam or ham (not spam). By employing NLP techniques and machine learning models, this system efficiently filters out spam messages.
